# Planned Features

This directory contains code for features that are planned but not yet implemented in the game.

## abilities/

**Status:** Planned  
**Feature:** Sect/Faction System

This directory contains ability definitions for a planned "Sects" or "Factions" system where heroes would belong to different factions and gain bonuses for using abilities from their faction.

**Planned Sects:**
- **Frost Sect** - Ice and cold-based abilities
- **Poison Sect** - Poison and damage-over-time abilities
- **Health Sect** - Healing and regeneration abilities
- **Regen Sect** - Mana and resource regeneration abilities
- **Shield Sect** - Defensive and protection abilities

**Implementation Status:**
- Ability definitions are written
- NOT yet integrated into hero definitions
- NOT yet integrated into game systems
- UI for sect selection not yet implemented

**Next Steps:**
1. Design sect bonus system (e.g., +10% damage for same-sect abilities)
2. Add sect property to hero definitions
3. Update ability shop to show sect information
4. Implement sect synergy bonuses
5. Add UI indicators for sect bonuses

**Note:** This code is NOT referenced anywhere in the active codebase (verified by grep search). It is kept for future implementation.
